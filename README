Description:
 A natural user interface for controlling robotic 
manipulator arms and human-like robots. The system
uses the Microsoft Kinect to interpret the 
controller's skeletal motion and map that to moving
the robot's servos.

 The system is implemented in C# and requires the
platform running the system to have Windows 7 as
well as the Kinect for Windows drivers installed.
It must be compiled on Visual Studio 2010 with the 
Kinect for Windows SDK installed.
